# Algorithm Performance Analysis using Probability and Statistics

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of sorting algorithms, namely QuickSort and MergeSort, using probability and statistics techniques. The goal is to compare the efficiency of these algorithms under different scenarios and dataset sizes.

## Objectives
- Implement QuickSort and MergeSort algorithms in Python.
- Develop a benchmarking framework to measure the runtime of these algorithms.
- Generate random datasets of varying sizes for experimentation.
- Apply probability and statistics techniques to analyze the collected data.
- Compare the performance of QuickSort and MergeSort using statistical methods.
- Visualize the results to facilitate interpretation and comparison.

## Implementation
- The project is implemented in Python.
- Sorting algorithms (QuickSort and MergeSort) are implemented as functions.
- A benchmarking framework measures the runtime of each algorithm for different dataset sizes.
- Random datasets are generated using the `random` module.
- Statistical analysis is performed using the `statistics` module.
- Results are visualized using the `matplotlib` library.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2.cd algorithm-performance-analysis
3. pip install matplotlib numpy
